  * This interesting, accurate, and up-to-date fourth edition provides an overview of child and adolescent development that reflects the best theories, research, and practical advice that developmentalists have to offer. Stressing the processes that underlie developmental change, the authors continue to explore the causes and complexities of development, challenging readers to think about the fascinating process of human development, to share in the excitement of this dynamic discipline, and to acquire a knowledge of developmental principles that will serve them well in their roles as parents, teachers, nurses, child care workers, pediatricians, psychologists, academics, or in any other capacity in which they may one day influence the lives of developing individuals.
